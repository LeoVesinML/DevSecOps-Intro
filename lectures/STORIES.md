# Story registry

Instructor file. Real incidents are the part students remember, so they are managed
like any other course asset instead of being reinvented per lecture.

Rules (from the course writing standard):

- Every lecture carries **at least one incident from the last 24 months** and **at most two
  classics older than five years**.
- Every story ends with **the control that would have caught it** and **the lab where the
  student builds that control**. A story without a mechanism gets cut.
- Repeating a story in a second lecture is allowed only when the second angle is different;
  the table below is what makes that a decision instead of an accident.
- Sources: post-mortems from the project or vendor, court filings, regulator reports,
  CISA/NCSC advisories. Vendor blogs for timelines only.

Status: `ok` verified against the source listed. `verify` used in a lecture that has not
had its sourcing pass yet. `cut` removed, kept here so it is not reintroduced.

## Candidates not yet placed

Researched, sourced, waiting for the lecture that fits.

| Incident | Year | Fits | Why it teaches |
|---|---|---|---|
| Microsoft Exchange Online / Storm-0558 signing key | 2023-2024 | lec2 or lec8 | A consumer key signed enterprise tokens: a trust boundary that existed on paper only. CSRB report is a rare public root-cause document |
| Polyfill.io supply-chain injection | 2024 | lec8 | A dependency that changed owner, not version. Pinning by version does not help; SRI and provenance do |
| Shai-Hulud npm worm | 2025 | lec8 | Self-propagating package compromise via stolen publish tokens (keep distinct from s1ngularity, now used in lec3) |
| ingress-nginx "IngressNightmare" CVE-2025-1974 | 2025 | lec7 | Admission controller reachable from any pod: cluster network policy -> lab 7 |
| Snowflake customer data theft (no enforced MFA) | 2024 | lec9 or lec10 | Not a product vulnerability: a missing control the customer owned |
| EPSS v4 and the CISA KEV catalogue | 2025 | lec10 | Prioritising by exploitation probability instead of CVSS alone |
